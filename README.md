Quick notes for myself. In case I accidentally forget ;)
1. Go to the docker website and download the whole lot.
2. Open docker quick start terminal or just make sure you have docker working. (Test with docker ps. Check that you don't get a message stating the question if you have docker running)
3. Run build.sh
Sit back and enjoy.
